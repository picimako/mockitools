This inspection reports arguments passed into <code>Mockito.mock()</code> and <code>Mockito.spy()</code> which are designed to determine the mock type based on
the variable's type they are assigned to, and not by the type passed into them.
<p>
    For example:
<pre>
    <code>
MockObject mockWithAnswer = Mockito.mock(Answers.CALLS_REAL_METHODS, someOtherObject);
MockObject spied = Mockito.spy(new MockObject(), new MockObject());
    </code>
</pre>
