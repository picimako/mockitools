Report calls to <code>toString()</code> in mock verifications, since Mockito cannot verify toString().
<p>
    The inspection doesn't distinguish between <code>toString()</code> calls that come directly as overridden methods
    from the mock objects' classes, or when they come from a type deeper in the class hierarchy.
