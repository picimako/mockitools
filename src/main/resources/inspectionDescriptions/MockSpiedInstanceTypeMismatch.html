This inspection reports when the mocked type and the type of the spied instance don't match
in a <code>mock(Type.class, withSettings().spiedInstance(...));</code>-type mock creation.
<p>
    Limitations: since validation for all possible cases would need the runtime type of both the mocked type and the
    spied instance, the inspection checks the mock creation only when the mock type is a <code>&lt;type>.class</code>-type
    expression e.g. <code>SomeObject.class</code>, and when the spied instance is a 'new' expression e.g. <code>new
    SomeObject<>()</code>.
<p>
    Based on Mockito's behaviour, in case of mocking/spying type with generic types, only the raw type is taken into
    account when determining the mismatch.
