This inspection will report any call to <code>Mockito.reset()</code>, regardless of its location in the test method.
Of course there may be cases where calling <code>reset()</code> is acceptable or even necessary, this inspection
doesn't take into account those cases.
<p>
    Based on Mockito's documentation on <a
        href="https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#resetting_mocks">resetting mocks</a>
<blockquote><i>"Smart Mockito users hardly use this feature because they know it could be a sign of poor tests.
    Normally, you don't need to reset your mocks, just create new mocks for each test method."</i></blockquote>

    <code>
@Test
void testMethod() {
    //mock setup
    MockObject mock = Mockito.mock(MockObject.class);
    when(mock.doSomething())...
    reset(mock); //reset() is called
    //another mock setup
    when(mock.doSomethingElse())...
}
