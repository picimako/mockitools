<!-- tooltip end -->
Reports multiple consecutive calls to <code>*Return()</code> methods, so that they may be merge into a single call.
<p>
    Both <code>org.mockito.Mockito</code> and <code>org.mockito.BDDMockito</code> based stubbing chains are supported,
    including calls to <code>doReturn()</code>, <code>thenReturn()</code> and <code>willReturn()</code>.
<p>
    If there are multiple sections of consecutive calls within the same call chain, they are reported separately for better notification,
    but upon invoking the quick fix, all sections are merged respectively.
