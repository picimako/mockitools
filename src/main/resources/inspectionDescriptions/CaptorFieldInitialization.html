Since <code>@Captor</code> annotated fields are initialized automagically by Mockito via
<code>MockitoJUnitRunner</code>, <code>MockitoJUnit.rule</code> or <code>MockitoAnnotations.initMocks()</code> /
<code>MockitoAnnotations.openMocks()</code>, there is no need for explicit initialization of them.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Explicit initializer is reported only when the field is annotated as <code>@Captor</code> and its type is
    <code>ArgumentCaptor</code>. Otherwise, you'll see another inspection reported, saying that @Captor fields must be
    of the type ArgumentCaptor.</p>
