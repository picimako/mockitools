This inspection reports spy creation on mock objects, for example
<pre>
<code>
Mockito.spy(Mockito.mock(...))
</code>
</pre>
    or
<pre>
<code>
Mockito.spy(&lt;object annotated with @Mock>)
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    The corresponding feature was introduced in Mockito 5.4.0, but this inspection does not do a library version check,
    and validates test code regardless of the Mockito version.
<p>
    NOTE: variables with Mockito.mock() initializers are not recognized as mocks yet.
