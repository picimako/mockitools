    based stubbings are supported, including calls to <code>doReturn()</code>, <code>thenReturn()</code> and <code>willReturn()</code>.
<p>
    If there are multiple sections of consecutive calls within the same call chain, they are reported separately for
    better notification, and can be merged separately.
