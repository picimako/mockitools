Converts <code>@Mock</code> and <code>@Spy</code> annotated fields to <code>Mockito.mock()</code> and <code>Mockito.spy()</code> local variable declarations,
respectively.
<p>
    Attributes of the <code>@Mock</code> annotation are also taken into account when constructing the Mockito.mock()/spy() calls.
<p>
    The created variable declaration is always added as the first statement to the selected method, which is selected according to this logic:
<ul>
    <li>if there is only one method in the class, then that is the target method</li>
    <li>if there are multiple methods in the class, then users are able to choose which method to introduce the variable in</li>
</ul>
<p>
    A detailed list of examples can be found in the <a
